                        <p>
                            Delay rates vary significantly across airlines, ranging from approximately 20% to 35%. 
                            This variation suggests operational efficiency differences and potential areas for improvement.

                        <h3>Hub Airport Impact</h3>
                        <p>
                            Major hub airports tend to experience higher delay rates due to increased traffic volume 
                            and complexity of operations. Smaller airports often demonstrate better on-time performance.

                        <p>
                            Delay patterns show clear seasonal variations and time-of-day effects, with peak travel 
                            times and weather-sensitive months showing increased delay frequency and duration.

                            Machine learning models achieve reasonable accuracy in predicting significant delays, 
                            with SVM slightly outperforming KNN. Route, time, and airline factors are key predictors.
